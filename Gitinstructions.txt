2. Open ur disire folder for this project.
3. Now open 'Git Bash' in it by right click and select git bash.
4. Write command->: git init {Press enter} {It will make folder as git environment}
5. Write command->: git config --global user.name "your name" {<-write ur name inside double quaotes}
6. Write command->: git config --global user.email "your email" {<-write ur email inside double quaotes}{write that email which u used for github}

For Downloading Respository:

1. Create Account on Github and install Git on ur Pc
2. Visit Link of Main Repository->: https://github.com/LovishChhura/MovieRecommendationSystem
3. Fork Main Repository. A copy of repository will be created with ur name on it👍
4. Open ur disire folder for this project.
